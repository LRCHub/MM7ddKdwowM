Tell me why
I'm so lost without you
And tell me why
I'm so lost without you

:
When I got the news I had the blues
Sad, confused
Wishin' I had some clues
So mad that we had to lose
Your life, I wish He would've took mine if he had to choose
Now I pay homage, nothin' is promised, we don't craft the rules
Your life was taken, man and it hurts in the worst way
And what's even deeper, I got this beat on your birthday
So I cherish every moment above where the earth lay
Gracious for the good times given, it's God's work
Hey, travelin' a Strange Journey with dreams of a dang gurney
Life presentin' pain, still I never let the thang burn me
Then my home girl passed, it's like a parallel dimension
Brought some things to my attention 'bout myself I had fail to mention
Preachin' to the heavens tryna get that ill extension
But I know it's just a matter of time
It made me want to defy science and create a time machine invention
I'll say I love you, hope you hearin' this rhyme
So tell me why

:
"Tell me why
I'm so lost without you"
No matter how far you go
Know that you're still with me
No matter how far you go
Know that you're still with me
"And tell me why
I'm so lost without you"
No matter how far you go
Know that you're still with me
No matter how far you go
Know that you're still with me

Rivers I do wander
No Rwanda, no Iran
Coulda been dealt the hand of death
But it just wasn't in thy plan
Always had some shelter and some rations in my hand
Didn't rock the tightest fashion in my Chucks or in my Vans
I was walkin' over junkies, everywhere but home
But your teachings were amongst me, never journey streets alone
Though I act just like some monkey, everyday I'm in this tree
You keep the branches strong, cause everyday y'all on y'all knees
Prayin' that the god that's in me, is for wishin'
Cause it took the early death of your daughter for mine to issue
She opened up my eyes to the wise, gave me true vision
And though she with our Heavenly Father, I pray she listens
Cause family has been the canopy that blocks the rain
Cause candidly I'd lose my sanity and all the pain
Of the world, and though we plan to be all that we can
We all ain't got the tree of kin that's rooted in my veins
So.

"Tell me why
I'm so lost without you"

:
This is dedicated to all my people who didn't make it to today. (Rest in peace.)
So many questions, not enough answers, but we'll get through it. (Still with us.)

"And tell me why
I'm so lost without you"
