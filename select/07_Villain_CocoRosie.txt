Give rise
To the villain
Give rise
To the head of
Deprived
Of the protector
And shield
From weather

My sister,
She used to goat's blood
To conceal her ravaged body
But,
I was gifted
With my uncle Freddy's baby
Froze in time
I could hide
Bloated belly,
Baby inside

Give rise
To the villain
Give rise
To the head of
Deprived
Of the protector
And shield
From weather

What happened
To my life
All this ain't right
I should have taken
It myself
With uncle Freddy's knife
Cause the grave is
Very suiting
For a bloodless
Daughter bride

Give rise
To the villain
Give rise
To the head of
Deprived
Of the protector
And shield
From weather
