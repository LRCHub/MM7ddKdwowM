What are you waiting for?
I can't take anymore
You make me sick to my core
And I've never felt so sure
What do you really need?
I've seen your heart still bleed
Every time I leave
There's nothing else I can see
No, there's nothing else I can believe
Please don't make me out to be
Something that I'm not
I tried to give you everything
But so much went wrong
I'm not a villain (villain)
I'm not a bad guy with a master plan
I'm not a monster (monster)
So don't say my name when you mention them
We both know that's a stretch
Perfection ain't real, how close can we get?
Fall short and miss by an inch
Love is a battle where nobody wins
Missiles fire back and forth
No one's innocent fighting a war
Everybody plays their part
We both screwed up from the start
We both shot holes in each other's hearts
Please don't make me out to be
Something that I'm not
I tried to give you everything
But so much went wrong
I'm not a villain (villain)
I'm not a bad guy with a master plan
I'm not a monster (monster)
So don't say my name when you mention them
