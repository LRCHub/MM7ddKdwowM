[00:48.87] You toss in a word
[00:50.98] And I'm your villain
[00:56.33] I see the passion emerge
[00:58.83] And I'm your villain
[01:08.83] 
[01:04.38] But serious
[01:07.76] You're so serious
[01:12.22] Oh, like a waiter
[01:14.07] Hating the rich
[01:15.42] But taking their tips
[01:25.92] 
[01:20.26] Oh, if I could laugh, I'd love you
[01:23.30] Oh, if I could smile at anything you said
[01:26.77] We could be laughing lovers
[01:29.33] I think you'd prefer to be miserable instead
[01:51.33] 
[01:32.56] If I could laugh, I'd love you
[01:35.96] Oh, if I could laugh like anybody else
[01:38.91] Like anybody else, like anybody else
[01:56.91] 
[02:15.49] I know what I am
[02:18.23] And I'm your villain
[02:23.52] Oh no, I don't give a damn
[02:26.57] If I'm your villain
[02:36.07] 
[02:31.82] 'Cause serious
[02:35.03] You're so serious
[02:39.34] But I've got ready salted
[02:41.53] Ready on your belly
[02:42.99] If you want to have fun
[02:54.49] 
[03:04.09] See you later, baby, see you later
[03:07.99] See you later, baby, see you later
[03:11.66] See you later, baby, see you later
[03:15.46] See you later, baby, see you later
[03:32.46] 
[03:19.43] See you later, baby, see you later
[03:22.64] See you later, baby, see you later
