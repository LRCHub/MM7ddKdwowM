He is everywhere
In the dirt, in the trees, in the streets
He in the church, in the jails, on the beach
It ain't a place that ain't touch these feets
He's the living word that is preached
In the dirt, in the trees, in the streets
He in the church, in the jails, on the beach
It ain't a place that ain't touch these feets
He's the living word that is preached
He is so raw, he don't need to be seen
He so raw he don't need you and me on his team
Responsible for nightmares and dreams
He's the winning lottery ticket that made you scream
He cam quiet any raging storm and
He's the reason your eyes popped open this morning
Give him praise with every piece of strength you got
Talking about being successful I'm sorry you not
And God ain't involved in your little biz
We can't make no moves till he makes his
He's the salt and the pepper, we the sheep he the shepherd
Took the ground from Nebuchadnezzar
Carried by God, never left stranded
And death is your free ticket to get off the planet
My father owns all the books
So if you rob me n***a I'm still rich as f**k
He is everywhere, every step of my path is a weapon
For I trust, left us blessed with the craft
And though many times I give less than what's asked
When tarnished he's varnish on my brass
My idol, I don't bail or fold?
In this cold world he's my snowplow
He's my knowhow, rights my wrongs in my iris
Makes sure that my sight is long
No Isis or Osiris, in my crisis Christ is the shining sun for the lightness
As I write this he puts heart in the lifeless
For the righteous he's a way out your plight
Just pray, in the hurricane you won't sway
For Latter Day Saints, here's what you don't say
Yahweh made me and out of one clay
My praise, shouldn't limit it to Sundays
